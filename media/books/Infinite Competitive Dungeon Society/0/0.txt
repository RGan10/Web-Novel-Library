When I was ten, my father sat me down and asked me.

“Shin, do you know who makes the most money in Korea?”

“The president.”

I was innocent.

“Wrong.”

“Mmm… Then male doctors!”

“Wrong again.”

“Male lawyers!”

“The Ministry of Gender Equality is going to take you away.”

“… Female lawyers?”

My father laughed at my careful response. “It’s the dungeon explorers.”

“… Huh?” At the age of ten, I learned about the existence of dungeons.
